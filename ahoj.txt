The UPDATE statement updates the values of specified columns in rows of a table, view or nickname, or the underlying tables, nicknames, or views of the specified fullselect.

Updating a row of a view updates a row of its base table, if no INSTEAD OF trigger is defined for the update operation on this view. If such a trigger is defined, the trigger will be executed instead. Updating a row using a nickname updates a row in the data source object to which the nickname refers.

The forms of this statement are:
The Searched UPDATE form is used to update one or more rows (optionally determined by a search condition).
The Positioned UPDATE form is used to update exactly one row (as determined by the current position of a cursor).
Invocation
An UPDATE statement can be embedded in an application program or issued through the use of dynamic SQL statements. It is an executable statement that can be dynamically prepared.

Authorization
The privileges held by the authorization ID of the statement must include at least one of the following authorities:
UPDATE privilege on the target table, view, or nickname
UPDATE privilege on each of the columns that are to be updated, including the columns of the BUSINESS_TIME period if a period-clause is specified
CONTROL privilege on the target table, view, or nickname
DATAACCESS authority
If a row-fullselect is included in the assignment, the privileges held by the authorization ID of the statement must include at least one of the following authorities for each referenced table, view, or nickname:
SELECT privilege
CONTROL privilege
DATAACCESS authority
For each table, view, or nickname referenced by a subquery, the privileges held by the authorization ID of the statement must also include at least one of the following authorities:
SELECT privilege
CONTROL privilege
DATAACCESS authority
If the package used to process the statement is precompiled with SQL92 rules (option LANGLEVEL with a value of SQL92E or MIA), and the searched form of an UPDATE statement includes a reference to a column of the table, view, or nickname in the right side of the assignment-clause, or anywhere in the search-condition, the privileges held by the authorization ID of the statement must also include at least one of the following authorities:
SELECT privilege
CONTROL privilege
DATAACCESS authority
If the specified table or view is preceded by the ONLY keyword, the privileges held by the authorization ID of the statement must also include the SELECT privilege for every subtable or subview of the specified table or view.

GROUP privileges are not checked for static UPDATE statements.

If the target of the update operation is a nickname, privileges on the object at the data source are not considered until the statement is executed at the data source. At this time, the authorization ID that is used to connect to the data source must have the privileges that are required for the operation on the object at the data source. The authorization ID of the statement can be mapped to a different authorization ID at the data source.
